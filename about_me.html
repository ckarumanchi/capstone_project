<h1> About Me</h1>

<hr>

<h4>Greetings! Welcome to my portfolio! My Name is Cindhuri Karumanchi! Join me as I take you on a tour and show you my passions, dreams, and hobbies through the world of programming!</h4>
<p>I'm someone who has been passionate about the world of technology from a young age. From my first Apple Ipod the 80 Gig Classic to be specific, to my self built PC. It's safe to say that my passion for this evolutionary industry has made me who I am today.</p>
    
<p>Next up: I am a HUGE Star Wars and Disney nerd. (You'll start to notice a theme with all my projects!)</p>

<p>In addition I am absolutely in love with hockey! The Toronto Maple Leafs are my team, and I will support them endlessly until we win our Stanley Cup! #GoLeafsGo! </p>

<p>Most importantly I have a very loving family, and two beautiful golden retrievers who push me to be the best version of myself everyday!</p>
